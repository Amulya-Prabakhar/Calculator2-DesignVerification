Description:
Academic Project for Functional Hardware Description, In this Project we were given a calculator designs, we developed the test environment for the specified design and wrote the test cases to verify and validate the Design. We used System Verilog for this project and used Questasim in Linux Platform as an IDE. The verification environment used to test Calculator design consists of transactor, generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard, environment, test and top files. It also had mailboxes for transmit data between generator to driver, generator to scoreboard, monitor to scoreboard. It also had interface file which connects DUT to test environment.
